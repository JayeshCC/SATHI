## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

We use a feature branch workflow:

```
main
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/user-authentication-enhancement
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/survey-analytics-dashboard
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bugfix/emotion-detection-accuracy
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hotfix/security-patch-2024
```

### Workflow Steps

1. **Create Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Develop & Test**:
   - Write code following our [coding standards](#coding-standards)
   - Add comprehensive tests
   - Test locally with sample data (never use real patient data)

3. **Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add user authentication enhancement
   
   - Implement JWT token management
   - Add password complexity validation
   - Include audit logging for security events
   
   Fixes #123"
   ```

4. **Push and Create PR**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): short description

Detailed description of changes made.
Include the impact and reasoning behind changes.

- Bullet point for specific change
- Another bullet point for another change

Fixes #issue-number
```

**Types**: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

## üìè Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)

Follow PEP 8 with these specific guidelines:

```python
# Good: Clear function documentation
def analyze_mental_health_score(survey_data: dict, user_id: str) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze mental health score based on survey responses.
    
    Args:
        survey_data: Dictionary containing survey responses
        user_id: Unique identifier for the user
        
    Returns:
        dict: Analysis results with risk assessment
        
    Raises:
        ValidationError: If survey data is invalid
    """
    # Implementation with proper error handling
    if not survey_data:
        raise ValidationError("Survey data cannot be empty")
    
    # Process with security considerations
    sanitized_data = sanitize_survey_input(survey_data)
    return process_analysis(sanitized_data)
```

### TypeScript (Frontend)

Follow strict TypeScript configuration:

```typescript
// Good: Well-typed component with proper documentation
interface SurveyFormProps {
  userId: string;
  onSubmit: (data: SurveyResponse) => Promise<void>;
  initialData?: Partial<SurveyResponse>;
}

/**
 * Survey form component for mental health assessment
 * Handles secure data collection and validation
 */
const SurveyForm: React.FC<SurveyFormProps> = ({ 
  userId, 
  onSubmit, 
  initialData 
}) => {
  // Implementation with proper error boundaries
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState<SurveyResponse>({
    ...defaultSurveyData,
    ...initialData
  });

  const handleSubmit = useCallback(async (data: SurveyResponse) => {
    try {
      await onSubmit(data);
    } catch (error) {
      logger.error('Survey submission failed', { userId, error });
      // Handle error appropriately
    }
  }, [onSubmit, userId]);

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* Form implementation */}
    </form>
  );
};
```

### Key Standards

- **Security First**: All code must consider healthcare data security
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper logging
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript strictly, avoid `any` types
- **Documentation**: Comment complex logic, especially ML algorithms
- **Testing**: Maintain >80% code coverage for new code

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Backend Testing

```python
# Unit test example
def test_mental_health_analysis_valid_data():
    """Test mental health analysis with valid survey data."""
    # Arrange
    survey_data = {
        "stress_level": 3,
        "sleep_quality": 2,
        "social_support": 4
    }
    user_id = "test_user_123"
    
    # Act
    result = analyze_mental_health_score(survey_data, user_id)
    
    # Assert
    assert result["risk_level"] in ["LOW", "MEDIUM", "HIGH", "CRITICAL"]
    assert "confidence_score" in result
    assert result["confidence_score"] >= 0 and result["confidence_score"] <= 1
```

### Frontend Testing

```typescript
// Component test example
describe('SurveyForm', () => {
  it('should validate required fields before submission', async () => {
    const mockOnSubmit = jest.fn();
    render(<SurveyForm userId="test123" onSubmit={mockOnSubmit} />);
    
    const submitButton = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /submit/i });
    fireEvent.click(submitButton);
    
    expect(mockOnSubmit).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
    expect(screen.getByText(/required field/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```
