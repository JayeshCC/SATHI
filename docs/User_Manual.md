## Frequently Asked Questions

### General System Questions

**Q: What is SATHI and how does it work?**

A: SATHI (System for Analyzing and Tracking Human Intelligence) is a comprehensive mental health monitoring platform designed for CRPF personnel. It works by:
- Collecting survey responses from soldiers about their mental state
- Using AI to analyze text responses for emotional indicators
- Optionally monitoring facial expressions during surveys for emotion detection
- Combining all data to create comprehensive mental health assessments
- Providing early warning systems for personnel who may need support

**Q: Is my personal information safe and confidential?**

A: Yes, absolutely. SATHI implements multiple layers of security:
- All data is encrypted both in storage and transmission
- Access is strictly limited to authorized personnel only
- Individual results are kept confidential and used only for support purposes
- The system complies with privacy regulations and organizational policies
- No personal data is shared with external parties without explicit consent

**Q: Who can see my survey results?**

A: Access to individual results is strictly controlled:
- **Your immediate supervisors** may see aggregate trends but not detailed individual responses
- **Mental health professionals** have access when providing support or counseling
- **System administrators** can access data for technical support only
- **Senior leadership** sees only anonymized, aggregate statistics
- Your **personal responses** are never shared in identifiable form without your consent

### Survey and Assessment Questions

**Q: How often do I need to complete surveys?**

A: Survey frequency depends on your organization's policy, but typically:
- **Weekly surveys** are standard for regular monitoring
- **Daily surveys** may be used during high-stress periods
- **Monthly surveys** might be sufficient for low-risk populations
- **Special surveys** may be conducted after significant events
- You'll receive notifications when surveys are due

**Q: What happens if I don't complete a survey on time?**

A: Missing surveys occasionally is not a problem, but consistent non-participation may:
- Result in follow-up from supervisors to ensure you're okay
- Lead to being classified as "no data" in risk assessments
- Prevent the system from providing helpful early warning indicators
- Be noted in compliance reports if surveys are mandatory

**Q: Can I change my answers after submitting a survey?**

A: No, once submitted, survey responses cannot be modified. This ensures:
- Data integrity and consistency
- Accurate trend analysis over time
- Prevention of retroactive changes that might skew results
- Authentic capture of your mental state at the time of completion

**Q: What if I'm having technical difficulties with webcam monitoring?**

A: Webcam monitoring is optional and surveys can be completed without it:
- Grant camera permissions when prompted by your browser
- Ensure good lighting and proper camera positioning
- If technical issues persist, contact IT support
- The survey will still work without webcam functionality
- Your responses are still valuable even without emotion detection

### Scoring and Assessment Questions

**Q: How are mental health scores calculated?**

A: The system uses a sophisticated multi-factor approach:
- **Text Analysis (70% weight)**: AI analyzes your written responses for emotional indicators
- **Emotion Detection (30% weight)**: Optional facial expression analysis during surveys
- **Combined Scoring**: Both factors are weighted and combined into a single score (0-1 scale)
- **Risk Categorization**: Scores are mapped to risk levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- **Trend Analysis**: Changes over time are considered for more accurate assessment

**Q: What does my mental health score mean?**

A: Scores are interpreted as follows:
- **0.0 - 0.3 (Low Risk)**: Good mental health, continue normal activities
- **0.3 - 0.5 (Medium Risk)**: Some stress indicators, increased monitoring recommended
- **0.5 - 0.7 (High Risk)**: Significant concern, counseling recommended
- **0.7 - 1.0 (Critical Risk)**: Urgent attention needed, immediate intervention required

Remember: These are indicators, not diagnoses. Professional assessment is always recommended for concerning scores.

**Q: Can the system make mistakes in assessment?**

A: Like any AI system, SATHI is highly accurate but not perfect:
- **False positives** may occasionally identify risk where none exists
- **False negatives** might miss some indicators in rare cases
- **Human oversight** is always required for important decisions
- **Professional assessment** should always accompany concerning scores
- **Multiple data points** over time provide more accurate pictures than single assessments

5. Save the new account
